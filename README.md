# WIKI COMING SOON <br /> "COMPATIBLE" WITH TA 0.7.9 / TAC 0.9.5 (MINOR CHANGES NEEDS TO BE MADE)

# TournamentTools #
This was originally made to be closed-sourced and only for use within the danish Beat Saber Discord, though someone asked me if I would open-source it, and I thought why not, more people would be able to collaborate on it and make it even better.

## Functions:
Stream Assets:
```
- Countdown file - Time remaining can be changed in Timer.txt - To activate CD, press "Interact" and click on the timer in OBS
```

The 1V1 Tools:
```
- Allows for the coordinator to push, and lock, the 1V1 overlay to 2 specific users.
- Allows for easy management of score-count.
- Allows coordinators to do Picks & Bans, and update the overlay real-time.  
```

The Battle Royale Tools:
```
- Allows for mass-creation of users on overlay.
- Allows for managing scores/alive.
- Allows for changing the spectated playername + stream. (The auto-stream changing requires HTTPS)
- Automatically removes users from the panel when declared dead and grays them out on the overlay.
```

## TODO:
| Function | Where | Why |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| User IDs type change | Everywhere | A numeric user ID shouldn't be a string, that simple |
| BeatKhana-support | WebPanel | To allows the user to input a BeatKhana tournament ID, which in return fetches participants, map-pool + bracket, making it easier for the coordinator to pick the match, and eliminates the need for manually typing in username, ScoreSaber ID and Twitch-link |
| TypeScript-version | Everywhere | To enforce types and allow for developers to collaborate easier |
